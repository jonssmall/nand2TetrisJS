# nand2TetrisJS
attempt to reproduce the nand2Tetris curriculum in JS. yep.
Got stuck at chapter 3 when I could no longer use functions to simulate input & output and needed a way to persist over time.

Maybe I could have used OOP or closures to manage state but if I redo this book it will be in the HDL they use.

Archiving since the functions so far are kinda cool.
